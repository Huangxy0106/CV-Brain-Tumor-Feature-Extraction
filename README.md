# CV-Brain-Tumor
Feature Extraction from Brain MRI Images

# About
This is the implementation of a feature extractor from images especially Brain MRI Images <br>

The main intention is to identify Brain Tumor, give it's properties like tumor area, tumor height and width. We extract the basic features of an image after thresholding like - Area, Perimeter, Convex Area, Solidity, Equivalent Diameter, Major Aix, Minor Axis, Eccentricity and pixel features like mean of pixels. Using pandas and matplotlib libraries, analysis and manipulation is done. Exporting as csv file of features will help in further usage of this data in ML Algorithms for predictions related to Brain Tumor.

# Applications
